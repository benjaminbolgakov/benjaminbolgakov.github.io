# Software Engineer

### Technical Skills:
Python, C/C++, Assembly, Linux, Redis, Docker, Bash, Git.

## Education
B.Sc Electrical Engineering | Linköping University

## Experience

#### Summer Intern @ Toyota Material Handling Sweden
- Developed a GUI tool for performing testing of hardware units.
- Built with Python and utilizing the convenience of JupyterLab's notebooks.

#### Bachelor Thesis @ Toyota Material Handling Sweden
- Investigated the feasibility of using Aruco markers for autonomous zone localization in warehouses utilizing only a single camera as the only sensor.
- Built a monocular odometry system enabling:
	- Camera calibration.
	- Pose estimation of detected Aruco markers, allowing for distance and heading to be calculated.
- Built a navigation control system that localized, based on the ID's of detected markers, what zone the vehicle is situated in and enforces a speed limit on the vehicle accordingly.


## Projects
### MonoVision - Monocular Odometry System
Inspired by the work on my bachelor thesis I continued to develop the python framework used for the thesis on my spare time.
**Project now includes:**
- Camera calibration.
- Aruco detection and pose estimation enabling distance and heading to be calculated.
- ORB-feature detection and matching between frames.
- Various visual odometry functions.

**In progress items:**
- FastSLAM implementation
